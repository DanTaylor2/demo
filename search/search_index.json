This document outlines our deployment strategies, tools, and best practices. Deployment Process Our software deployment process typically follows these steps: Development and Testing Staging Environment Deployment User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Production Deployment Post-Deployment Monitoring Tools and Technologies We utilize the following tools for our deployment pipeline: Version Control : Git with Azure DevOps Continuous Integration : Jenkins Configuration Management : Ansible Containerization : Docker Orchestration : Kubernetes Monitoring : Prometheus and Grafana Deployment Strategies Contoso employs several deployment strategies depending on the project requirements: Blue-Green Deployment This strategy involves maintaining two identical production environments, with only one active at a time. It allows for quick rollbacks and minimal downtime. Canary Releases We gradually roll out changes to a small subset of users before releasing it to the entire infrastructure. This helps in identifying any issues early on. Rolling Updates For certain applications, we use rolling updates to progressively update instances of the old version with the new version. Best Practices Always use version control for all configuration files and scripts Automate as much of the deployment process as possible Implement robust logging and monitoring Conduct thorough testing in staging environments before production deployment Have a well-defined rollback plan for each deployment Continuous Improvement We regularly review and refine our deployment processes to ensure we're using the most efficient and reliable methods. Feedback from development teams and end-users is crucial in this ongoing improvement process.
